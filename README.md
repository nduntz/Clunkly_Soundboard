# Clunkly_Soundboard
Made in Unity, this is the frame work for a soundboard
This includes: 
  a main menu
  6 directory buttons for 6 different boards
  a forward and back button
  Sound button (my app has duplicating 3x4 grid for each board)
  Long sound button (Use for longer soundbites that you wish to turn on and off)
  Also a buggy swipe menu to use inplace of forward and back buttons
Have fun!
